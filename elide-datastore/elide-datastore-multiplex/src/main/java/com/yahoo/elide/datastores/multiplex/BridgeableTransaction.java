/**
 * The bridgeable transaction describes an interface suitable for handling composite models
 * across stores. More concretely, consider the following example model:
 *
 * <code>
 *   public class User {
 *     String name;
 *     MyOtherObject otherObject;
 *   }
 * </code>
 *
 * If we assume <em>User</em> is managed by a MySQL datastore and the <em>MyOtherObject</em> entity is managed by a
 * Redis datastore, the MultiplexManager will use a bridgeable store if applicable. The bridgeable store enables
 * the writer to determine how to lookup a cross-store relationship via key construction and transaction selection.
 *
 * <strong>NOTE:</strong> that since Elide binds a particular <em>type</em> to a datastore attributes will be looked up
 * using the datastore reasonable for managing that entity.
 *
 * <strong>N.B.</strong> this interface should be implemented on the relevant store in which a particular object lives.
 *           That is, considering the example above, the Redis store would implement this interface to bridge
 *           automagically from MySQL.
