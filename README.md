## Background

[Elide](http://elide.io/) is a Java library that lets you set up a [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) or [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) web service with minimal effort starting from
a [JPA annotated data model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API).

Elide supports a number of features:

### Security Comes Standard
Control access to fields and entities through a declarative, intuitive permission syntax.

### Mobile Friendly APIs
JSON-API & GraphQL lets developers fetch entire object graphs in a single round trip. Only requested elements of the data model are returned.
Our opinionated approach for mutations addresses common application scenarios:
* Create a new object and add it to an existing collection in the same operation.
* Create a set of related, composite objects (a subgraph) and connect it to an existing, persisted graph.
* Differentiate between deleting an object vs disassociating an object from a relationship (but not deleting it).
* Change the composition of a relationship to something different.
* Reference a newly created object inside other mutation operations.

Filtering, sorting, and pagination are supported out of the box.

### Atomicity For Complex Writes
Elide supports multiple data model mutations in a single request in either JSON-API or GraphQL. Create objects, add them to relationships, modify or delete together in a single atomic request.

### Persistence Layer Agnostic
Elide is agnostic to your particular persistence strategy. Use an ORM or provide your own implementation of a data store.

### Schema Introspection
Explore, understand, and compose queries against your Elide API through generated Swagger documentation or GraphQL schema.

### Customize
Customize the behavior of data model operations with computed attributes, data validation annotations, and request lifecycle hooks.

## Install

To try out an Elide example service (with a Postgres database), you can deploy via Heroku.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/yahoo/elide)

The code that generates this example can be found [here](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/tree/master/elide-example/elide-blog-example)

Alternatively, use [elide-standalone](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/tree/master/elide-standalone) which allows you to quickly setup a local instance
of Elide running inside an embedded Jetty application.

## Usage

To use Elide, create a set of JPA annotated data models that represent the domain model of your web service:

```java
@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private Set<Author> authors;
}
```

Add Elide annotations to both expose your models through the web service and define security policies for access:


```java
@Entity
@Include(rootLevel = true)
@ReadPermission("Everyone")
@CreatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
@DeletePermission("Noone"
@UpdatePermission("Noone")
public class Book {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    @UpdatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private Set<Author> authors;
}
```

Add Lifecycle hooks to your models to embed custom business logic that execute inline with CRUD operations through the web service:

```java
@Entity
@Include(rootLevel = true)
@ReadPermission("Everyone")
@CreatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
@DeletePermission("None")
@UpdatePermission("None")
@LifeCycleHookBinding(operation = UPDATE, hook = BookCreationHook.class, phase = PRECOMMIT)
public class Book {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    @UpdatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private Set<Author> authors;
}

public class BookCreationHook implements LifeCycleHook<Book> {

    @Override
    public void execute(LifeCycleHookBinding.Operation operation, Book book,
                        RequestScope requestScope, Optional<ChangeSpec> changes) {
       //Do something
    }
}
```

Map expressions to security functions or predicates that get pushed to the persistence layer:

```java
    public static class IsAdminUser extends UserCheck {
        @Override
        public boolean ok(User user) {
            return isUserInRole(user, UserRole.admin);
        }
    }
```

To expose these models, follow the steps documented in [elide-standalone](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/tree/master/elide-standalone):

```java
public class YourMain {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    ElideStandaloneSettings settings = new ElideStandaloneSettings() {

        @Override
        public String getModelPackageName() {
            //This needs to be changed to the package where your models live.
            return "your.model.package";
        }

        @Override
        public Map<String, Class<? extends Check>> getCheckMappings() {
            //Maps expression clauses to your security check functions & predicates
            return new HashMap<String, Class<? extends Check>>() { {
                put("Admin", IsAdminUser.class);
            }
        };
    });

    ElideStandalone elide = new ElideStandalone(settings);

    elide.start();
  }
}
```
