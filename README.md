## Background

[Elide](https://elide.io/) is a Java library that lets you setup model driven [GraphQL](http://graphql.org) or [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) web service with minimal effort.  Elide supports two variants of APIs:

1. A CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for reading and manipulating models.
2. An analytic API for aggregating measures over zero or more model attributes.

Elide supports a number of features:

### Security Comes Standard
Control access to fields and entities through a declarative, intuitive permission syntax.

### Mobile Friendly APIs
JSON-API & GraphQL lets developers fetch entire object graphs in a single round trip. Only requested elements of the data model are returned.
Our opinionated approach for mutations addresses common application scenarios:
* Create a new object and add it to an existing collection in the same operation.
* Create a set of related, composite objects (a subgraph) and connect it to an existing, persisted graph.
* Differentiate between deleting an object vs disassociating an object from a relationship (but not deleting it).
* Change the composition of a relationship to something different.
* Reference a newly created object inside other mutation operations.

Filtering, sorting, pagination, and text search are supported out of the box.

### Atomicity For Complex Writes
Elide supports multiple data model mutations in a single request in either JSON-API or GraphQL. Create objects, add them to relationships, modify or delete together in a single atomic request.

## Analytic Query Support
Elide supports analytic queries against models crafted with its powerful semantic layer.  Elide APIs work natively with [Yavin](https://github.com/yahoo/yavin) to visualize, explore, and report on your data.

### Schema Introspection
Explore, understand, and compose queries against your Elide API through generated Swagger documentation or GraphQL schema.

### Customize
Customize the behavior of data model operations with computed attributes, data validation annotations, and request lifecycle hooks.

### Storage Agnostic
Elide is agnostic to your particular persistence strategy. Use an ORM or provide your own implementation of a data store.

## Documentation

More information about Elide can be found at [elide.io](https://elide.io/).

## Install

To try out an Elide example service, check out this [Spring boot example project](https://github.com/yahoo/elide-spring-boot-example).

Alternatively, use [elide-standalone](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/tree/master/elide-standalone) which allows you to quickly setup a local instance of Elide running inside an embedded Jetty application.

## Usage 

The following examples leverage elide 5 (now in pre-release).  For documentation on prior/stable versions, visit [here](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v4/01-start.html).

### For CRUD APIs

The simplest way to use Elide is by leveraging [JPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Persistence_API) to map your Elide models to persistence:

The models should represent the domain model of your web service:

```java
@Entity
public class Book {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private Set<Author> authors;
}
```

Add Elide annotations to both expose your models through the web service and define security policies for access:

```java
@Entity
@Include(rootLevel = true)
@ReadPermission("Everyone")
@CreatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
@DeletePermission("None")
@UpdatePermission("None")
public class Book {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    @UpdatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private Set<Author> authors;
}
```

Add Lifecycle hooks to your models to embed custom business logic that execute inline with CRUD operations through the web service:

```java
@Entity
@Include(rootLevel = true)
@ReadPermission("Everyone")
@CreatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
@DeletePermission("None")
@UpdatePermission("None")
@LifeCycleHookBinding(operation = UPDATE, hook = BookCreationHook.class, phase = PRECOMMIT)
public class Book {

    @Id
    private Integer id;

    @UpdatePermission("Admin OR Publisher")
    private String title;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "books")
    private Set<Author> authors;
}

public class BookCreationHook implements LifeCycleHook<Book> {
    @Override
    public void execute(LifeCycleHookBinding.Operation operation,
                        LifeCycleHookBinding.TransactionPhase phase,
                        Book book,
                        RequestScope requestScope,
                        Optional<ChangeSpec> changes) {
       //Do something
    }
}

```

Map expressions to security functions or predicates that get pushed to the persistence layer:

```java
    @SecurityCheck("Admin")
    public static class IsAdminUser extends UserCheck {
        @Override
        public boolean ok(User user) {
            return isUserInRole(user, UserRole.admin);
        }
    }
```

To expose and query these models, follow the steps documented in [the getting started guide](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/01-start.html).

For example API calls, look at:
1. [*JSON-API*](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/10-jsonapi.html) 
2. [*GraphQL*](https://elide.io/pages/guide/v5/11-graphql.html)

### For Analytic APIs

Analytic models including tables, measures, dimensions, and joins can be created with a friendly HJSON configuration language:

```hjson
{
  tables: [
    {
      name: Orders
      table: order_details
      measures: [
        {
          name: orderTotal
          type: DECIMAL
          definition: 'SUM({{order_total}})'
        }
      ]
      dimensions: [
        {
          name: orderId
          type: TEXT
          definition: '{{order_id}}'
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
