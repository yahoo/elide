## 4.5.1
**Features**
 * Issue #851. Added new method `enableSwagger()` in `ElideStandaloneSettings` class which allows an easier way for binding swagger docs to the given endpoint. Override this method returning the `Map<String, Swagger>` object to bind the swagger docs to string endpoint.
 * Issue #900. Add `@ApiModelProperty` support to `elide-swagger` that makes it possible to customize `description`, `example`, `readOnly` and `required` attributes of object definitions in resulting generates Swagger document.

**Fixes**
 * [Security] Bump jackson databind from 2.9.9 to 2.9.9.3

 * HttpStatusException class now supports the following additional functions: `getErrorResponse(boolean encodeResponse)` and `getVerboseErrorResponse(boolean encodeResponse)`
 * Add `GraphQLErrorSerializer` and `ExecutionResultSerializer` which are added to the `ObjectMapper` provided by the ElideSettings. These are used to parse the GraphQL results, instead of using `ExecutionResult#toSpecification`.

* Elide standalone now includes a Hikari connection pool & Hibernate batch fetching by default

## 4.4.3

 * Enable support for JPA @MapsId annotation on relationships so that client doesn't have
   to provide a dummy ID to make entity creation work.

## 4.0.2
**Fixes**

**Fixes**
 * Updated MIT attribution for portions of MutableGraphQLInputObjectType
 * getRelation (single) call filters in-memory to avoid collision on multiple objects being created in the same transaction.

**Features**
 * ChangeSpec is now passed to OnUpdate life cycle hooks (allowing the hooks to see the before & after change to a given field).

## 4.0-beta-2
**Fixes**
 * Root collection loads now push down security filter predicates.
 * Avoid throwing exceptions that must be handled by the containing application, instead throw exceptions that will be handled directly within Elide.
 * Restore OnCreatePreSecurity lifecycle hook to occur after fields are populated.

**Features**
 * Added UPDATE operation for GraphQL.

## 4.0-beta-1
**Features**
 * Elide now supports GraphQL (as well as JSON-API).  This feature is in beta.  Read the [docs](elide.io) for specifics.  Until the artifact moves to stable,
   we may change the semantics of the GraphQL API through a minor Elide version release.
 * The semantics of `CreationPermission` have changed and can now apply towards fields as well as entities.  `UpdatePermission` is never
   checked for newly created objects.
 * The semantics of `SharePermission` have changed.  `SharePermission` can no longer have an expression defined.  It either denies permission
   or exactly matches `ReadPermission`.
 * RSQL queries that compare strings are now case-insensitive. There is not currently a way to make
   case sensitive RSQL queries, however the RSQL spec does not provide this either.
   Fixes #387

**Fixes**
 * Updated PreSecurity lifecycle hooks to run prior to inline checks like they should.

**Misc**
 * All deprecated functions from Elide 3.0 have been removed.
