## 4.5.1
**Features**
 * Issue #851. Added new method `enableSwagger()` in `ElideStandaloneSettings` class which allows an easier way for binding swagger docs to the given endpoint. Override this method returning the `Map<String, Swagger>` object to bind the swagger docs to string endpoint.
 * Issue #900. Add `@ApiModelProperty` support to `elide-swagger` that makes it possible to customize `description`, `example`, `readOnly` and `required` attributes of object definitions in resulting generates Swagger document.

 * Alpha release of a new Elide data store (SearchDataStore) that supports full text search on top of an existing data store.
 * Issue #871. Add ElideSettings property `encodeErrorResponses`, which when enabled will encode error messages to be safe for HTML. This works for both JSONAPI and GraphQL endpoints, with verbose errors or error object settings enabled/disabled.
 * HttpStatusException class now supports the following additional functions: `getErrorResponse(boolean encodeResponse)` and `getVerboseErrorResponse(boolean encodeResponse)`
 * Add `GraphQLErrorSerializer` and `ExecutionResultSerializer` which are added to the `ObjectMapper` provided by the ElideSettings. These are used to parse the GraphQL results, instead of using `ExecutionResult#toSpecification`.

**Fixes**

**Fixes**
 * Issue 801
 * Switched to Open JDK 8
 
## 4.4.4

 * Support RSQL INFIX, POSTFIX, and PREFIX filters on number types: remove '*' before coercing.

**Features**
* Issue#812 Add support for BigDecimal field in GraphQL. 
* Elide standalone now includes a Hikari connection pool & Hibernate batch fetching by default

## 4.4.3
**Features**
 * When fetching a collection, if there are no filters, sorting, or client specified pagination, the ORM backed data stores will return the proxy object rather than construct a HQL query.  This allows the ORM the opportunity to generate SQL to avoid the N+1 problem.

**Fixes**
 * Fixes bug where EntityManager creation for ElideStandalone was not thread safe.

## 4.4.2
**Fixes**
 * Fix error in lookupEntityClass and add test
 * Restore Flush mechanism for Hibernate but allow for customization.

## 4.4.1

 * Enable support for JPA @MapsId annotation on relationships so that client doesn't have
   to provide a dummy ID to make entity creation work.

**Fixes**
 * Flush once for patch extension
 * ConstraintViolationExceptions are propagated on flush (JPA Transaction)
 * Enable support for JPA @MapsId annotation on relationships so that client doesn't have
   to provide a dummy ID to make entity creation work.
 * Cache all calls to getEntityBinding

**Fixes**
 * Fixed bug where create-time pre-security hooks were running before any values were set.

## 4.1.0
**Fixes**
 * Performance enhancements including caching the `Class.getSimpleName`.
 * Fixed bug where updatePreSecurity lifecycle hook was being called for object creation.  This will no longer be true.  This changes the behavior of life cycle hooks (reason for minor version bump).

**Features**
 * Added the ability to register functions (outside entity classes) for lifecycle hook callbacks.

## 4.0.2
**Fixes**
 * Add support for retrieving values from java `Map` types. These are still modeled as lists of key/value pairs.

 * Handle the `Transaction not closed` error on aborted response.

## 4.0.1

## 4.0.0

See: 4.0-beta-5

## 4.0-beta-5
**Fixes**
 * Ignore non-entity types if present in the hibernate class metadata in the hibernate stores. This can legitimately occur when tools like envers are used.

**Features**
 * Support GraphQL batch requests.

## 4.0-beta-4
**Fixes**
 * Ignore provided-- but null-- operation names and variables in GraphQL requests.
 * Add additional logging around exception handling.
 * Don't swallow generic Exception in Elide. Log it and bubble it up to caller.
 * Fix a bug where null filter expressions were possible if no filter was passed in by the user, but permission filters existed.
 * Fix support for handling GraphQL variables.
 * Support java.util.Date types as new built-in primitive. Expects datetime as epoch millis.
 * Fixed issue with supporting variables in mutations.
 * Allow for arbitrary in-transaction identifiers for upserts (treated as unique identifier for current tx only).
 * Ensure GraphQLEndpoint returns GraphQL spec-compliant response.

**Features**
 * Handle ConstraintViolationException's by extracting the first constraint validation failure.
 * Include GraphQL in Elide standalone by default with ability to remove it via dependency management.
 * Upgrade to the latest graphql-java version: 6.0.

## 4.0-beta-3
**Fixes**
 * Updated MIT attribution for portions of MutableGraphQLInputObjectType
 * getRelation (single) call filters in-memory to avoid collision on multiple objects being created in the same transaction.

**Features**
 * ChangeSpec is now passed to OnUpdate life cycle hooks (allowing the hooks to see the before & after change to a given field).

## 4.0-beta-2
**Fixes**
 * Root collection loads now push down security filter predicates.
 * Avoid throwing exceptions that must be handled by the containing application, instead throw exceptions that will be handled directly within Elide.
 * Restore OnCreatePreSecurity lifecycle hook to occur after fields are populated.

**Features**
 * Added UPDATE operation for GraphQL.

## 4.0-beta-1
**Features**
 * Elide now supports GraphQL (as well as JSON-API).  This feature is in beta.  Read the [docs](elide.io) for specifics.  Until the artifact moves to stable,
   we may change the semantics of the GraphQL API through a minor Elide version release.
 * The semantics of `CreationPermission` have changed and can now apply towards fields as well as entities.  `UpdatePermission` is never
   checked for newly created objects.
 * The semantics of `SharePermission` have changed.  `SharePermission` can no longer have an expression defined.  It either denies permission
   or exactly matches `ReadPermission`.
 * RSQL queries that compare strings are now case-insensitive. There is not currently a way to make
   case sensitive RSQL queries, however the RSQL spec does not provide this either.
   Fixes #387

**Fixes**
 * Updated PreSecurity lifecycle hooks to run prior to inline checks like they should.

**Misc**
 * All deprecated functions from Elide 3.0 have been removed.
 * `FilterPredicates` have been restructure to share a common `Path` with other Elide code.

## 3.2.0
**Features**
 * Updated interface to beta standalone application. Plans to finalize this before Elide 4.0 release.

**Fixes**
 * Rollback relationship handling change.
 * Handle ForbiddenAccess only for denied Include, instead of filtering to empty set.
