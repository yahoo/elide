# Elide Example Models

A canonical _set_ of data models that:
1. Are used for unit tests
2. Are used for IT tests
3. Provide examples/illustrations of how to do different things with Elide

There should be a separate package for each set of codependent models.

  <groupId>com.yahoo.elide</groupId>
