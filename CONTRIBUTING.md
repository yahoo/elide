# How to contribute
First, thanks for taking the time to contribute to our project! There are many ways you can help out.

### Questions

If you have a question that needs an answer, [create an issue](https://github.com/paion-data/elide/issues/new), and label it as a question.

### Issues for bugs or feature requests

If you encounter any bugs in the code, or want to request a new feature or enhancement, please [create an issue](https://github.com/paion-data/elide/issues/new) to report it. Kindly add a label to indicate what type of issue it is.

### Contribute Code
We welcome your pull requests for bug fixes. To implement something new, please create an issue first so we can discuss it together.

***Creating a Pull Request***
Please follow [best practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices) for creating git commits.  In addition: 

- Make sure your code respects existing formatting conventions. In general, follow
  the same coding style as the code that you are modifying. If you are using
  IntelliJ, you can import our code style settings xml:
  [elide-intellij-codestyle.xml](https://github.com/paion-data/elide/raw/master/elide-intellij-codestyle.xml)
  or [elide-eclipse.importorder](https://github.com/paion-data/elide/raw/master/elide-eclipse.importorder).
- Do add/update [documentation](https://github.com/paion-data/elide-doc) appropriately for the change you are making.
- Bugfixes should include a unit test or integration test reproducing the issue.
- Do not use author tags/information in the code.
- Always include license header on each file your create. See [this example](https://github.com/paion-data/elide/blob/master/elide-core/src/main/java/com/yahoo/elide/Elide.java)
- Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for unrelated
  features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests into one pull request.
- Keep the number of commits small and combine commits for related changes.
  Each commit should compile on its own and ideally pass tests.
- Keep formatting changes in separate commits to make code reviews easier and
  distinguish them from actual code changes.

When your code is ready to be submitted, [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) to begin the code review process.

We only seek to accept code that you are authorized to contribute to the project. We have added a pull request template on our projects so that your contributions are made with the following confirmation: 

> I confirm that this contribution is made under the terms of the license found in the root directory of this repository's source tree and that I have the authority necessary to make this contribution on behalf of its copyright owner.
